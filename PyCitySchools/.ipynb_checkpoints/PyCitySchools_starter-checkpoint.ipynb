    "1. The school type matters. If you look at the analysis, all the top 5 schools are charter schools and the bottom 5 schools are district schools. Charter schools did better than district schools in math scores. It could be because these schools have a smaller student population per school.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. District schools have a larger student population and a higher budget. They spend more money per student, however that did not lead to better scores. It could be due to district having a larger student population and maybe student-teacher ratio is greater in district schools, but more analysis and date is needed to see is this is due to such school practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Looking at sizes, small and medium schools performed way better on scores than large size schools (89-90% overall passing versus 58%) which can be seen from school type analysis as Charter schools are smaller than District schools.\n"
